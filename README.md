# OSRS-Timeline

This project was inspired by a post from a few years ago by u/Phantomat0, [OSRS Timeline with playercount](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/7hdqsj/osrs_timeline_with_playercount/). I used the [vis.js](https://visjs.org/) library to visualize the timeline and graph. 
Player count data is taken from: https://www.misplaceditems.com/rs_tools/graph/.
All images are taken from the [OSRS wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/).

I tried to include updates that had a significant impact on the game. I didn't include every quest or content update, because it would become very cluttered. Let me know if you think I missed anything major, or if you have any other ideas!
